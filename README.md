## References
All of our achievements were made achievable thanks to the robust AI community in Kyrgyzstan and the contributions made by individuals within the AkylAI project (by TheCramer.com). We also express our gratitude to Stanford for their outstanding efforts and extend the accessibility of this dataset to a global audience.

## Dataset
We used ChatGPT and Google Translate to convert [alpaca_data.json](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/blob/main/alpaca_data.json) into Kyrgyz. Although the translation wasn't perfect, we found it to strike a reasonable balance between cost and quality. The total cost for translating the entire dataset into Kyrgyz was approximately $100.00. If you're interested in learning more about the dataset's creation process, you can visit [the Stanford Alpaca page](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca).

## Next
We work with Kyrgyz linguists to improve the quality of the translation.
